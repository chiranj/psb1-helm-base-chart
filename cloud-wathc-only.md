```json
{
  "dashboard": {
    "title": "USPTO System Health - Executive View",
    "panels": [
      {
        "title": "Patent Applications Processed Today",
        "type": "stat",
        "targets": [{
          "datasource": "CloudWatch",
          "metricName": "patent_applications_total",
          "namespace": "USPTO/Applications"
        }]
      },
      {

        }]
      },
      {
        "title": "Fee Revenue Processed",
        "type": "stat",
        "targets": [{
          "metricName": "fee_revenue_total",
          "namespace": "USPTO/Applications"

## üí∞ Cost Analysis for USPTO

### Annual Cost Estimate (Medium Scale)
| Component | Annual Cost | Justification |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **CloudWatch Metrics** | $36,000 | 1M metrics/month @ $0.30/metric |
| **CloudWatch Logs** | $24,000 | 100GB/month @ $0.50/GB |
| **X-Ray Traces** | $12,000 | 2M traces/month @ $5/1M traces |
| **Managed Grafana** | $10,800 | 3 editor licenses @ $9/month |
| **ADOT Compute** | $6,000 | EKS node overhead |
| **Total** | **$88,800** | vs $150K+ for Option 1 |

### Cost Optimizations
```yaml
# Log retention by criticality
log_groups:
  audit_logs: 2557 days    # 7 years (required)
  application_logs: 365 days  # 1 year
  debug_logs: 30 days      # 1 month
  
# Metric sampling for cost control
sampling_rules:
  production: 100%         # All prod metrics
  staging: 50%             # Half of staging
  development: 10%         # Minimal dev metrics
```

## üöÄ Implementation Roadmap

- Deploy ADOT collector in pilot cluster
- Configure CloudWatch namespaces
- Set up basic dashboards

### Phase 2: Production (Weeks 3-4)
- Roll out to all production clusters
- Configure alerting rules
- Train operations team

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Weeks 5-6)
- Add X-Ray tracing
- Create executive dashboards
- Implement cost controls

### Phase 4: Optimization (Weeks 7-8)
- Fine-tune retention policies
- Optimize metric sampling
- Performance validation

## üéØ Success Metrics for USPTO

1. **System Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for patent/trademark systems
2. **Performance**: <2s response time for patent searches
3. **Cost Efficiency**: <$100K annual observability spend
4. **Compliance**: 100% audit log retention compliance
5. **User Satisfaction**: <5 minute incident detection time

## Alternative: If Budget Allows Option 1

**Only consider Option 1 if:**
- USPTO modernizes to microservices architecture (50+ services)
- Need advanced PromQL queries for complex analytics
- Have dedicated SRE team with Prometheus expertise
- Congressional appropriation specifically for advanced monitoring

**For most USPTO use cases, CloudWatch-Centric provides:**
‚úÖ 99% of required observability capabilities
‚úÖ 40% lower cost than Option 1
‚úÖ Government compliance out-of-the-box
‚úÖ Operational simplicity for government IT teams
